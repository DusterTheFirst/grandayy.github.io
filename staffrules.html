        This website is startin to get out of date. We will soon change this website to a nicer one. <a class="a" draggable="false" href="https://github.com/grandayy/grandayy.github.io/tree/dev">Click here</a> to see the current progress.
        </div>
        <ol class="rules">
            <li>In order for something to happen, you need a majority Villian and Super Mod vote</li>
            <li>Leaking any staff exclusive chat &mdash;without the consent of everyone in the screenshot&mdash; will result in a warn</li>
            <li>If a staff member has 3 warns this will result in a demote, For super mods and villains this is 4 warns</li>
            <li>No role abusing (kicking, banning, warning, muting, etc without a reason)</li>
            <li>Staff members cannot do a ?clearwarn on themselves, with warns newer than two weeks</li>
            <li>No conversations in #announcements, that includes shitposts</li>
            <li>Members who recently got promoted, must wait 14 days before another promotion</li>
            <li>You must provide a valid reason in any warns and or bans</li>
            <li>You can't warn someone for something that happened more than 24 hours ago</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Failure to follow any rules will have following effects:
            <br> First Warning = No Punishment.
            <br> Second Warning = 60 Minute Mute. (?mute @nasty 60m for 2 warns)
            <br> Third Warning = 1440 Minute/24 Hour Mute. (?mute @PieBot 1440m for 3 warns)
            <br> Fourth Warning = 1 Month Ban. (?ban @scarce for 4 warns)
            <br> You must check the users warnings before giving them their punishment and make sure they are all valid.
            <br> Also for Super Mods+, If you have 4 warns, you get dem00te, or 5 which is a bean.
