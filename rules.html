                Do not complain about the server in the server itself, you’ll not achieve anything by doing this apart from causing drama and ruining the fun, instead use the feedback form or talk it out in DMs                <br>

            All rules are subject to change. Do not try to find any loopholes for these rules, for example, changing your name to "grandayyy" with 3 y's and saying "I changed it". And also, use common sense dammit.
            Also, if you have any suggestions/questions about the server, DM the
