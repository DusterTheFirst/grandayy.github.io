        <h1 class="rules">Server Rules</h1>
        
        <ol class="rules">
            <li>No racial intolerance of any kind is allowed in this server, you're not allowed to say "ni**er"</li>
            <li>Opinions are obviously allowed, as long as they do not contain extreme hate speech. Breaking this rule will result in an instant ban.</li>
            <li>Have respect for <del>wamen</del> other server members</li>
            <li>Do not leak other people's personal info. It's wrong and not allowed, we’ll ban you instantly. This includes sharing n00ts (personal info), and DM’s, without their express permission.</li>
            <li>Do not post <strong>any</strong> nsfw links/pictures in this server. You’ll get banned instantly.</li>
            <li>Do not impersonate bots, grandayy or any other server member (Via name, nickname or profile picture) (And don’t pull shit with setting your name to grandayyy and saying it’s not the same)</li>
            <li>You have to listen to the staff team, f.e. when they tell you to stop something, stop it.</li>
            <li>Do not ping anyone without a reason or multiple times in a row, especially grandayy and if they stated for themselves not to be pinged do not ping them.</li>
            <li>This is an <strong>English</strong> Speaking and English based server, so English is the <strong>primary</strong> language we all communicate in. <strong>Refrain</strong> from speak in other languages.</li>
            <li>Please don't be a cunt, there is no need to be that one annoying cunt ruining the fun for others.</li>
            <li>Don't try to frame different members about a raid. Just give away the info or don't warn us. Simple as that.</li>
            <li>No alternate accounts allowed. When we find out, the alt is instantly banned, and your main account will be warned</li>
            <li>Don't ping roles or users without a valid reason. Only ping roles in an emergency (for example raids). So when you see a user mention that they don’t want to get pinged, don’t ping them.</li>
            <li>No spam of ANY kind. It's annoying. (This includes reactions, botcommands (aka api ab0se) and text walls. This does apply to Direct/Private Messages with server members)</li>
            <li>Upon joining, if you are warned within the first few hours, and you leave, that will count as a raid</li>
            <li>No begging for a role. You're not a dog <del>woof</del>. We don't need it and if we think you deserve a role we will give it to you. If you reached a level which gets you a role, normally if you wait a few minutes, mee6 will give it to you, if that does not happen for some reason, ping an online <a class="Villain" href="roles.html#Villian">Villain</a>, and they’ll give you the role.</li>
            <li>Use channels the way they are intended, there’s a channel description for them all at the top.</li>
            <li>Just don’t play earrape in any voice chat. It’s only allowed if everyone in the voice-channel agrees to it and must be turned off when one or more had enough. So if you’re with others in a channel, get permission from other members or it's not allowed. This does include selfbots and microphones.</li>
            <li>Only advertise in #pics-advertise-vids. Don’t post the same link/picture too often (e.g. every fifth message), that will count as spam.</li>
            <li>Keep most bot commands in #botcommands (like t!profile, t!top, !rank and music commands). But small commands like t!reverse and p.say is fine, as it's basically just a different way of chatting. Just don't break the rules with the commands (like doing p.say ni--er or t!reverse re--in). This includes the message replies with xayah. However, don’t use the bot too much in #robbies-hideout (song lyrics and gifs) for that will be warnnale for spam. Use #botcommands for that instead<br>The use of voting commands is prohibited to the #botcommands channel or a specific channel created for voting (EX: for events)</li>
            <li>Only post pictures in #robbies-hideout if it's relevant to what is being talked about. Pirates+ can post pics there.</li>
            <li>Spoiling things like tv shows, games etc outside of #robbies-basement will result in a warn.</li>
            <li>Do not complain about the server in the server, use the <a draggable="false" href="feedback.html">feedback form</a> instead. If you are on mobile, contact a <a class="Villain" href="roles.html#Villian">Villain</a> as since it's very hard to do it.</li>

            Failure to follow any rules will have following effects:<br> First Warning = No Punishment. 
            <br> Second Warning = 60 Minute Mute. 
            <br> Third Warning = 24 Hour Mute. 
            <br> Fourth Warning = 1 Month Ban
        </p>

        <p>
            All rules are subject to change. Do not try to find any loopholes for these rules, for example, changing your name to "grandayyy" with 3 y's and saying "I changed it". And also, use common sense dammit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, if you have any suggestions/questions about the server, DM the <a draggable="false" class="Villain" href="roles.html#Villian">Villains</a> instead of grandayy, we will always read DM's.
