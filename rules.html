    <p><b>Rule 1: </b>Opinions are obviously allowed, as long as they do not contain extreme hate speech. Breaking this rule will result in an instant ban.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 2: </b>Don't just be a cunt. There is no need to be that one annoying cunt ruining all the fun.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 3: </b>Talk English when people tell you to do so.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 4: </b>You have to listen to the staff team.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 5: </b>Have respect for <f style="text-decoration: line-through;">women</f> other server members.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 6: </b>No NSFW pictures or talk. This is your only warning. (You will be insta banned for this no matter how many warnings)</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 7: </b>Don't ping roles or users without a valid reason. Only ping roles in an emergency (for example raids).</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 8: </b>No spam of ANY kind. It's annoying. (This includes reactions and text walls, and applies to Direct/Private Messages with server members).</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 9: </b>Only advertise in #pics-advertise-vids.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 10: </b>Don't play earrape songs in #musichub.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 11: </b>Please don't beg for a role, it's annoying. If we think you deserve a role we will give you it.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 12: </b>Keep most bot commands in #botplaying. (Like t!profile and t!top). But small commands like t!reverse is fine, as it's basically just a different way of chatting. This includes the message replies with xayah.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 13: </b>Only use t!vote or other vote commands in #robbieshideout if they will be for a short period of time. For longer votes, use #botcommands</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 14: </b>Please don't impersonate anyone. We get that you want to be memes like Stingy, but don't go around pretending to be grandayy or anyone on the server.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 15: </b>Only post pictures in #robbies-hideout if it's relevant to what is being talked about or if you want to start a conversation about this. Pirates+ can post pics there.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 16: </b>Don't try to frame different members about a raid. Just give away the info or don't warn us. Simple as that.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Rule 17: </b>Do not leak other people's personal info. It's wrong and not allowed, I'll ban you instantly. This includes n00ts</p>
