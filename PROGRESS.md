# Progress
### 17/11/17
We have started to create mockups for profiles, warnings, and the main page.

Be warned that these beasts are not ready for mobile.

#### Where can I see the mockup version?
[Here!](https://github.com/grandayy/mockups) Be aware that the beasts must be trained for mobile support before upl00ting them.

#### Conclusion
Screenshots of the Profile and warnings mockup will be uploaded after the beasts are trained for mobile. 
ETA of the fully-functioned, working, nice designed, finally trained beasts/website is yet to be estimated as since those beasts are hard to train.
We know we are apart of a big brand here (if ya wanna call it that), so we are trying our best to achieve the goals which we have setted above. This can take from weeks to years.
Thank you for following the god damn train CJ.
