# PROJECT THICC.

### What are we doing?
We are making this website more interconnected with the guild/server itself.

### What we are adding:
- Interfacing with [RobbieBotten](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/RobbieBotten),
- Adding profiles and descriptions,
- Making the website mobile friendly & making it look hella good,
- And adding functions so then the website can be used for more uses.

### Why though?
Because the current is old looking and not mobile friendly.
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><sub>also we am hella bored</sub></span>

### Whomst is helping: 
 - [DusterTheFirst](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst) | backend and functionality of client
 - [TheFallingPie](https://github.com/TheFallingPie) | maintains the front end
 
 # Progress
 ### 17/11/17
 We have started to create mockups for the following;
- Profile,
- Warnings,
- Mainpage.

#### What are we doing today?
These are not mobile friendly yet. Today [TheFallingPie](https://github.com/TheFallingPie) will be making the profile and warnings mockup mobile friendly.

#### Where can I see the mockup version?
[Here!](https://github.com/grandayy/mockups) Be aware that the mobile support needs to be done before uploading them.
#### Conclusion
Screenshots of the Profile and warnings mockup will be uploaded later once the mobile version is finished. 
ETA of the complete website is yet to be estimated.
We know we are apart of a big brand here (if ya wanna call it that), so we are trying our best to achieve the goals which we have setted above. This can take from weeks to years.
Thank you for following the god damn train CJ.
