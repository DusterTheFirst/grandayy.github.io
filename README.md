# PROJECT THICC.

### What are we doing?
We are making this website more interconnected with the guild/server itself.

### What we are adding:
- Interfacing with [RobbieBotten](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/RobbieBotten),
- Adding profiles and descriptions,
- Making the website mobile friendly & making it look hella good,
- And adding functions so then the website can be used for more uses.

### Why though?
Because the current is old looking and not mobile friendly.
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><sub>also we am hella bored</sub></span>

### Whomst is helping: 
 - [DusterTheFirst](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst) | backend and functionality of client
 - [TheFallingPie](https://github.com/TheFallingPie) | maintains the front end
