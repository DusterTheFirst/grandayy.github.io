# PROJECT THICC.

### What are we doing?
We are making this website more interconnected with the guild/server itself.

### What we are adding:
- Interfacing with [RobbieBotten](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/RobbieBotten),
- Adding profiles and descriptions,
- Making the website mobile friendly & making it look hella good,
- And adding functions so then the website can be used for more uses.

### Why though?
Because the current is old looking and not mobile friendly.
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><sub>also we am hella bored</sub></span>

### Whomst is helping: 
 - [DusterTheFirst](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst) | backend and functionality of client
 - [TheFallingPie](https://github.com/TheFallingPie) | maintains the front end
 
 # Progress
 ### 17/11/17
 We have started to create mockups for the following;
- Profile,
- Warnings,
- Mainpage.

Be warned that these beasts are not ready for mobile.
#### What are we doing today?
On this lovely day of which we call today, [TheFallingPie](https://github.com/TheFallingPie) will be making the profile and warnings mockup mobile ready.

#### Where can I see the mockup version?
[Here!](https://github.com/grandayy/mockups) Be aware that the beasts must be trained for mobile support before upl00ting them.
#### Conclusion
Screenshots of the Profile and warnings mockup will be uploaded after the beasts are trained for mobile. 
ETA of the fully-functioned, working, nice designed, finally trained beasts/website is yet to be estimated as since those beasts are hard to train.
We know we are apart of a big brand here (if ya wanna call it that), so we are trying our best to achieve the goals which we have setted above. This can take from weeks to years.
Thank you for following the god damn train CJ.
