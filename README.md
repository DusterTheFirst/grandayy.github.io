# PROJECT THICC.

### What are we doing?
We are making this website more interconnected with the guild/server itself.

### What we are adding:
- Interfacing with [RobbieBotten](https://github.com/DusterTheFirst/RobbieBotten),
- Adding profiles and descriptions,
- Making the website mobile friendly & making it look hella good,
- And adding functions so then the website can be used for more uses.
