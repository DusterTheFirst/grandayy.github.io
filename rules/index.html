        <h1>Server Rules</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li>No role abuse (kicking, banning, muting, etc without a reason)</li>
            <li>Don't just be a cunt. There is no need to be that one annoying cunt ruining all the fun.</li>
            <li>No NSFW pictures in any channel except for #nsfw-hub! This is your only warning. (Type \nsfw in #botplaying for access) (You will be insta banned for this no matter how many warnings)</li>
            <li>Don't ping roles or users without a valid reason. Only ping roles in an emergency (for example raids).</li>
            <li>Don't ping roles or users without a valid reason. Only ping roles in an emergency (for example raids).</li>
            <li>No spam of ANY kind. It's annoying. (This includes reactions and applies to Direct/Private Messages with server members)</li>
            <li>Only advertise in #pics-advertise-vids.</li>
            <li>Please don't beg for a role, it's annoying. If we think you deserve a role we will give you it.</li>
            <li>Keep most bot commands in #botplaying. (Like t!profile and t!top). But small commands like t!reverse is fine, as it's basically just a different way of chatting.</li>
            <li>Please don't impersonate anyone. We get that you want to be memes like Stingy, but don't go around pretending to be grandayy or any staff member.</li>
            <li>Only post pictures in #robbies-hideout if it's relevant to what is being talked about or if you want to start a conversation about this. Pirates+ can post pics there.</li>
            <li>If you warn us about a raid but you are being really cryptic and not giving away any info you will be counted to be in on the raid, and will be banned. Especially don't try to frame different members. Just give away the info or don't warn us. Simple as that.</li>
            <li>If you have 2+ warnings you won't be eligible for Net, however you can have your warnings cleared after 2 weeks of your latest warning (contact a Server Manager or the person that warned you about that, in a DM. No one else).</li>
            <li>Do not leak other people's personal info. It's wrong and not allowed, I'll ban you instantly.</li>
        </ol>
        
        Failure to follow any rules will have following effects: First Warning = No Punishment. Second Warning = 60 Minute Mute. Third Warning = Kick. Fourth Warning = Permanent Ban

        All rules might get changed, and new rules might get added. Please do not try to find any loopholes for these rules, like changing your name to "grandayyy" with 3 y's and say "I changed it". And also, use common sense dammit.

        Also, if you have any suggestions/questions about the server, DM the @Server Manager (which is me) or @Villains instead of grandayy, we always read DM's.
