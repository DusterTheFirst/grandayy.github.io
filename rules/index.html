        <h1>Server Rules</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Opinions are obviously allowed, as long as they do not contain extreme hate speech. Breaking this rule will result in an instant ban.</li>
            <li>Don't just be a cunt. There is no need to be that one annoying cunt ruining all the fun.</li>
            <li>No NSFW pictures in any channel except for #nsfw-hub! This is your only warning. (Type \nsfw in #botplaying for access) (You will be insta banned for this no matter how many warnings)</li>
            <li>Don't ping roles or users without a valid reason. Only ping roles in an emergency (for example raids).</li>
            <li>No spam of ANY kind. It's annoying. (This includes reactions and text walls,  and applies to Direct/Private Messages with server members)</li>
            <li>Only advertise in #pics-advertise-vids.</li>
            <li>Don't play earrape songs in #musichub</li>
            <li>Please don't beg for a role, it's annoying. If we think you deserve a role we will give you it.</li>
            <li>Keep most bot commands in #botplaying. (Like t!profile and t!top). But small commands like t!reverse is fine, as it's basically just a different way of chatting. This includes the message replies with xayah.</li>
            <li>Only use t!vote or other vote commands in #robbieshideout if they will be short. For longer votes, use #botcommands</li>
            <li>Please don't impersonate anyone. We get that you want to be memes like Stingy, but don't go around pretending to be grandayy or anyone on the server.</li>
            <li>Only post pictures in #robbies-hideout if it's relevant to what is being talked about or if you want to start a conversation about this. Pirates+ can post pics there.</li>
            <li>Especially don't try to frame different members. Just give away the info or don't warn us. Simple as that.</li>
            <li>Do not leak other people's personal info. It's wrong and not allowed, I'll ban you instantly. This includes n00ts</li>
        </ol>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>
            Failure to follow any rules will have following effects:<br> First Warning = No Punishment. 
            <br> Second Warning = 60 Minute Mute. 
            <br> Third Warning = Kick. 
            <br> Fourth Warning = 1 Month Ban
        </p>

        <p>
            All rules are subject to change. Do not try to find any loopholes for these rules, for example, changing your name to "grandayyy" with 3 y's and saying "I changed it". And also, use common sense dammit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, if you have any suggestions/questions about the server, DM the <span style="color:#961DCF">Villains</span> instead of grandayy, we will always read DM's.
        </p>
